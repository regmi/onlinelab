This directory contains a pre-initialized database, 
the search_index, and possible several log files.

pre-initialized database 
------------------------
The pre-initialized database is created out of convenience
and contains one default user with username=admin, password=admin.

The database is created by running the following command:
    $ django-admin.py syncdb --settings=frontend.settings --pythonpath=.
In the top-level directory created by running:
    $ codenode-admin init -name some_codenode


search_index
------------
The Whoosh search_index directory is created when the following command is run:
    $ twistd codenode
Which in turn causes the following code to execute:
    from codenode.frontend.search import search
    search.create_index() #this is idempotent
    

log files
---------
From the Twisted server process.
