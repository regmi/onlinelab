Motivation and philosophy of codenode
=====================================

Core ideas, user focused
------------------------

Getting things done in your web browser is really convenient.
Even better, it doesn't even have to be *your* web browser.
You can use the one at school, work, or your friends laptop to
send that important email or update your groups wiki page.

`Codenode` creates an entire programming environment, in a web browser,
so you can run your code anywhere, at anytime.

Take for example a common situation:  You are at school or work,
and the computer you are on doesn't have a certain program installed,
it's a major hassle to install it yet again, assuming you have
permission to do so, or it ends up installing correctly.

With `codenode`, your code, data, and extra programs are stored and 
running somewhere else that you can rely on, just like your email.
You simply login to you account and get coding right away.


Core ideas, developer focused
-----------------------------

`Codenode` is a system that allows computation of arbitrary code pieces from a
web browser.  Along with management of this (remote or local) running code,
we aim to present the source and result of these computations, in a clean, 
modern, and useful way.
