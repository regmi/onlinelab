Using codenode
--------------
* When `codenode` first loads, you see the `Bookshelf`.  This is where you manage your `Notebooks`. 
* At the top left of the `Bookshelf`, click *New Notebook* to get started.
* After the `Notebook` loads, click on the top of the *blank white area* and a *solid black line* will appear.
* Now immediately type *2+2*, this creates your first `Cell`.  
* While holding down the *Shift Key*, hit *Enter* to run the code. *4* will appear below.
* You did it. Now create more `Cells`, or go back and change the one just created.
